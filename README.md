## Git
I'm currently having a bit of a challenge installing Git on my PC, so I was not able to clone my repository yet. I tried completing the Create Your First Commit tutorial manually on GitHub and while I managed most of itcl oning the repo is still an issue. I'm also still learning how to navigate Git and GitHub, especially from the command line but I'm getting there one step at a time.

Week 0 was not too challenging. The lectures explained everything clearly and my bootcamp foundation definitely helped me understand the material faster. I was able to complete Problem Set 0 without much confusion.
